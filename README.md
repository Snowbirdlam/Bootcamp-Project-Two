# <Bootcamp-Project-Two>

## Description

It was created to showcase my profile online in order to attract employers. It is better than describing my work on resume or a cover letter, it helps to more uniquely show it. 

I learned more about how to use CSS and working with media queries. I also understand a bit better on how to format elements on a page. 


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text]("/images\Screenshot 2023-11-30 181224.png")
This one shows the navigation bar, the nav buttons are live and can take you to whereever on the page
you wish to navigate to. 

![alt text]("images\Screenshot 2023-11-30 181253.png")
These two images are links, press on them to be redirected to websites I have created. 

![alt text]("images\Screenshot 2023-11-30 181306.png")

## Credits

I have been helped by Tom Gold in getting the links to work when you click on the "Previous Work" and "Refactoring" images.
